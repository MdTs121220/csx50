Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Increasing the number of simulations from 10 to 1000000 did not get results that match reality, namely France as the 2018 WC champion.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Several times the simulation, but can not be said to be good enough.
